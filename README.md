# Stock Up Smart Shopping List

## Overview

[Stock Up](https://stock-up-shopping-list.vercel.app) is a smart shopping list app that was built in collaboration with The Collab Lab [tcl-52](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-52-smart-shopping-list) team. Following the conclusion of the project, I added my own touch to the app by adding TailwindCSS and refactoring features.

### What is this project?

The goal of the project was to collaborate within the [tcl-52 team](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-52-smart-shopping-list) to create a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

Throughout the engagement - we planned out sprints, reviewed individual PRs, provided feedback, and conducted demos during each 2-week sprint. We used GitHub projects to create and manage stories as well as conduct sprint retros.

### How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
